# Summation of currents based FEM solver

This solver can be used to predict the self-inductance and mutual inductance of coils, as well as the inductance change due to the presence of a conductive object near the coil. The code has been developed to predict the influence of a 3D nozzle on the inductance of a coil in order to be able to calibration the nozzle offsets in x and y.
